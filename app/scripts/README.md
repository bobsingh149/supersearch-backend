This directory contains utility scripts for the SuperSearch application.

## Guidelines

1. **Do not commit sensitive data**: No API keys, credentials, or sensitive information should be included in these scripts.
2. **Document your scripts**: Each script should have a descriptive header comment explaining what it does.
3. **Error handling**: Scripts should include proper error handling and logging.
4. **Naming convention**: Use descriptive names that reflect the script's purpose.

## Common Scripts

- Data processing utilities
- One-time migration scripts

**Note**: Scripts that contain sensitive information or are for local development only should be added to `.gitignore`.
